It is often used to optimize the hyperparameters of a machine learning model. GP-BO models the function to be optimized as a Gaussian Process, which is a probability distribution over functions. This allows it to make probabilistic predictions about the function's behavior and use this information to decide where to sample next. The algorithm iteratively improves its model of the function and selects the next point to evaluate based on the acquisition function which balances exploration and exploitation. The goal is to find the global minimum or maximum of the function by using the least number of evaluations.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"351533a1","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-01-13T04:53:26.33896Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-01-13T04:53:26.338066Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-01-13T04:53:27.465145Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-01-13T04:53:27.464154Z"},"papermill":{"duration":1.136649,"end_time":"2023-01-13T04:53:27.468339","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-01-13T04:53:26.33169","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[],"source":["from
