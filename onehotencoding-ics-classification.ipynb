To effectively handle categorical data, we apply the OneHotEncoding technique, ensuring that our model can interpret and utilize these categorical features efficiently. Our model of choice is the `LGBMClassifier`, a powerful gradient boosting framework known for its high performance and speed. To validate the robustness and generalizability of our model, we employ a 5-fold cross-validation approach. This method splits our dataset into five parts, training the model on four parts and validating it on the fifth, rotating through all parts to ensure a comprehensive evaluation."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"15498ac5","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.007804,"end_time":"2024-07-16T09:37:36.676762","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-07-16T09:37:36.668958","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["###
